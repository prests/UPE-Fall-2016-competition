# UPE-Fall-2016-competition
Python oriented code that reads data from a json that stores information from a bomberman game and then sends a move using html requests.

This code is not very clean since it was time pressured and edits were made on the fly. It was a pleasure competing at RPI's honor coding
society, and I can't wait for next year.
